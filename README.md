## ‚ú® Features

- **Instant Signature Verification:** Upload two signature images and determine if they belong to the same person.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a Siamese ResNet18 neural network for robust feature extraction and comparison.
- **Intuitive UI:** Smooth, modern Streamlit interface with side-by-side signature display, results, confidence gauge, and adjustable threshold.
- **Configurable:** Easily swap out the model, tune thresholds, or run locally/offline.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**1. Clone the repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Satya481/Signature-Verification-.git
cd Signature-Verification-
```

**2. Set up your Python environment**
```sh
python -m venv .venv
# Activate your virtual environment:
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Get the model file**
- Place your trained `siamese_signature.pth` (PyTorch state_dict) in the same folder as `app.py`
- **Or** set its path via environment variable:
  ```sh
  export MODEL_PATH=/path/to/siamese_signature.pth
  ```

**5. Run the app**
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

**6. Open the link shown in your terminal** (usually [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501))

## üñºÔ∏è How It Works

- The app uses a **Siamese Neural Network** based on ResNet18 to generate 128-dimensional embeddings of each uploaded signature image.
- The distance between these embeddings indicates similarity:
  - **Smaller distance** = more similar = more likely to be genuine.
- You control the "Decision Threshold" in the sidebar for fine-tuning.
- After uploading two signatures and clicking **"Verify"**, you'll see:
  - Badge: "Genuine" ‚úîÔ∏è or "Forgery" ‚ùå
  - Distance score
  - Confidence estimate
  - A progress gauge and interpretation

## üß† Model Details

- **Architecture:** Siamese ResNet18, final layer replaced with `nn.Linear(...,128)`
- **Input:** 224x224 grayscale signature images (PNG/JPG)
- **Output:** Pairwise distance between embeddings
- **Decision:** If distance < threshold, classified as "Genuine", else "Forgery"

**Example Model Definition:**
```python
class SiameseNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        base = models.resnet18(weights=models.ResNet18_Weights.DEFAULT)
        base.fc = nn.Linear(base.fc.in_features, 128)
        self.base = base

    def forward_once(self, x):
        return self.base(x.repeat(1,3,1,1))  # Ensure 3 channels

    def forward(self, x1, x2):
        e1 = self.forward_once(x1)
        e2 = self.forward_once(x2)
        return e1, e2
```

## üèóÔ∏è Training Pipeline (Optional)

- See `signature_verification.ipynb` for full training and evaluation pipeline.
- Dataset structure:
  ```
  signatures/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ writer_001/
    ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ original_1.png
    ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ forgeries_1.png
    ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ writer_002/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
  ```
- Model is trained using contrastive loss, evaluated on ROC AUC and genuine/forged accuracy.
